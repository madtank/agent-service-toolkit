Reflection¶
In the context of LLM agent building, reflection refers to the process of prompting an LLM to observe its past steps (along with potential observations from tools/the environment) to assess the quality of the chosen actions. This is then used downstream for things like re-planning, search, or evaluation.

Reflection

This notebook demonstrates a very simple form of reflection in LangGraph.

Introduction:
Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's The Little Prince is a timeless novella that has captured the hearts and minds of children and adults alike for over seven decades. Its enduring charm and profound wisdom have transcended generations, making it a classic staple in childhood literature. This essay explores the reasons why The Little Prince remains relevant in modern childhood.

First Paragraph:
One of the primary reasons for The Little Prince's relevance is its exploration of themes that resonate with children today. The story addresses universal aspects of childhood, such as the struggle to understand the world, the desire for friendship and love, and the pain of loss and loneliness. The Little Prince's encounters with various grown-ups, each representing different facets of adult absurdity, mirror the confusion and disillusionment children experience as they grow and navigate their way through a complex world.

Second Paragraph:
Moreover, The Little Prince promotes values that are essential for modern childhood. It emphasizes the importance of imagination, creativity, and curiosity, encouraging children to question, explore, and seek their own truths. The Little Prince's friendship with the fox teaches children about the value of emotional connections, empathy, and responsibility, lessons that are increasingly vital in our technology-driven, fast-paced society.

Third Paragraph:
The Little Prince also serves as a reminder of the significance of nature and the environment in our lives. The story's depiction of the desert, the baobabs, and the mysterious asteroid B-612 fosters an appreciation for the beauty and fragility of the natural world. In an era of climate change and environmental degradation, The Little Prince's message about the importance of nurturing and preserving our planet is more relevant than ever.

Fourth Paragraph:
Furthermore, The Little Prince offers a unique perspective on mental health and emotional well-being. The story delicately tackles issues such as depression, isolation, and the search for meaning, providing a nuanced understanding of these complex topics. By presenting these themes in a relatable and age-appropriate manner, The Little Prince helps children develop emotional intelligence and resilience, enabling them to better cope with the challenges they face in their daily lives.

Conclusion:
In conclusion, The Little Prince remains a relevant and essential read for modern childhood due to its exploration of timeless themes, promotion of essential values, emphasis on nature and environmental stewardship, and sensitive treatment of mental health and emotional well-being. By engaging with this classic tale, children can gain invaluable insights and skills that will serve them well throughout their lives.

Conclusion¶
Now that you've applied reflection to an LLM agent, I'll note one thing: self-reflection is inherently cyclic: it is much more effective if the reflection step has additional context or feedback (from tool observations, checks, etc.). If, like in the scenario above, the reflection step simply prompts the LLM to reflect on its output, it can still benefit the output quality (since the LLM then has multiple "shots" at getting a good output), but it's less guaranteed.
